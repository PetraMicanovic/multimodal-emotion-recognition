# Multimodal Emotion Recognition

This repository contains experiments for emotion recognition using
multimodal and unimodal models.

## Environment Notes
Experiments were conducted in Google Colab using a CUDA-enabled PyTorch setup. Specific package versions may vary depending on the execution environment.


## Datasets

- **MELD**  
  [Multimodal EmotionLines Dataset](https://affective-meld.github.io/) used for training and evaluation of multimodal emotion recognition models (audio, text, video).

- **SEAC**  
  [Serbian Emotional Amateur Cellphone Speech Corpus (SEAC)](https://www.ktios.ftn.uns.ac.rs/sadapt/SADAPT_publications.html) used for audio-only emotion recognition experiments. Models trained on MELD audio are used for initialization.

  ## Dataset Licenses
  All datasets used in this repository are subject to their original licenses and are not distributed here.

## Versions
 
- **v0.1-baseline-meld**
  - Audio baseline model (no pooling)
  - Text baseline model (BERT embeddings)
  - Early fusion baseline model (feature-level fusion)

No class weighting, encoder fine-tuning, or advanced fusion strategies are included.

- **v0.2 – meld-temporal-pooling**
  - Temporal pooling over audio features (mean + std)
  - Class-weighted CrossEntropy loss
  - Improved robustness to class imbalance

## Notes
Datasets and trained model weights are not included in this repository.
